        <h1>A Poison Tree</h1>
        <p> I was angry with my friend: <br>
            I told my wrath, my wrath did end.<br>
            I was angry with my foe:<br>
            I told it not, my wrath did grow.</p>

       <p>  And I watered it in fears. <br>
            Night and morning with my tears:<br>
            And I sunned it with smiles.<br>
            And with soft deceitful wiles. </p>

        <p> And it grew both day and night.<br>
            Till it bore an apple bright.<br>
            And my foe beheld it shine.<br>
            And he knew that it was mine. </p>

        <p> And into my garden stole.<br>
            When the night had veild the pole;<br>
            In the morning glad I see;<br>
            My foe outstretchd beneath the tree. </p>
